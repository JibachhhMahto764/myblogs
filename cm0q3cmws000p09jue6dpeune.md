### 2\. MVC (Model View Controller) Model:

<mark>Model:</mark> The central component of the pattern. It is the application’s dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface. It directly manages the data, logic, and rules of the application.

<mark>View</mark>: Any Representation of information such as a chart, diagram or table. In other words, the user interface.

<mark>Controller</mark>: Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.

## 3\. what is Composer?

### 5.what is Eloquent ORM (Object Relational Mapper)

The way you interact with the database without writing complex SQL queries.

$posts= Post::gets(); If you want to apply the filter, need only active posts:

$activePosts=Post::where('active',true); Blade syntax and templating Write once, use forever. Do not rewrite code every time you need a new page. Complied into plain PHP and cached. Views can extend layouts.

## **6.what is Template Engine:**

Laravel PHP framework is best for its built-in lightweight templates which we can use to create beautiful layouts using dynamic content seeding.  
This .blade.php file extension helps Laravel Developer to get and change a clean and customizable layout of their web page without any hassle.  
Moreover, it has multiple widgets incorporating CSS and JS code with stable structures. The templates of laravel frameworks are innovatively designed to create a simple layout with distinctive sections.

## **7.Security:**

Similarly, it will also provide you with high-class security by generating encrypted passwords through Bcrypt Hashing Algorithm, and it also prepared SQL statements that prevent SQL injection attacks

Also, it provides you with the service of changing database structure and helps to modify it by using PHP code instead of SQL. Laravel Schema Builder helps to create database tables & insert indices.

## **9\. Unit-Testing:**

Laravel is the best framework for web app developers due to its excellent way of unit testing. Laravel is capable enough to run multiple unit tests. Also, it ensures that the new modifications done by the developer do not suddenly break the web apps.  
Generally, laravel have stable releases in the industry as it is careful of the known failures. Apart from this, the developers can easily write the unit-tests in their code.

Laravel supports the testing with PHP Unit with its file extension a phpunit.xml file. Moreover, it also supports unit testing that ensures there are no exceptions or bugs in your web application before it goes live.

Comparatively, automation testing is more exact compared to the manual one, less time consuming and helps the developer in eliminating the errors, bugs, glitches, etc. that in adherence to the initial app requirements.

As after every web development, verifying and testing is the most crucial steps in the process. Without testing, no one can make sure that the application is free from such errors.

## **10\. URL Routing Configuration**

Laravel offers a very expressive & simple method of defining routes as the basic. Laravel routes accept a closure & a URI specified in the app/Http/routes.php file. On the app, it will provide you with the flexibility to choose which route is triggering.

An error page on your web app can cost you a huge customer base as most of the customers never return to a blank page.
