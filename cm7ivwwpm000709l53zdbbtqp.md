AWS offers a broad set of global cloud-based products that can used as building blocks for common cloud architecture.

### AWS Foundational services

Here is a look at how these cloud-based products are organized. The AWS global infrastructure can be broken down into three elements. Regions, availability zones, and points of presence, which include edge locations. This infrastructure provides the platform for a broad set of services such as networking, storage, computing services, and databases, and these services are delivered as an on-demand utility that is available in seconds with pay-as-you-go pricing.

AWS offers a broad set of cloud-based services. There are 23 different product or service categories, and each category consists of one or more services.
