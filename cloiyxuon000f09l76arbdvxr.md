TypeScript is a free and open-source high-level programming language developed by Microsoft that adds static typing with optional type annotations to JavaScript. It is designed for the development of large applications and transpilers to JavaScrip.

This means that your existing working JavaScript code is also TypeScript code. The main benefit of TypeScript is that it can highlight unexpected behavior in your code, lowering the chance of bugs.

## Typescript Interface

TypeScript knows the JavaScript language and will generate types for you in many cases. TypeScript is a programming language that supports both dynamic and static typing. It provides classes, visibility scopes, namespaces, inheritance, unions, interfaces, and many other features. Also, it offers comments, variables, statements, expressions, modules, and functions.

You can execute it on Node.Js or any other browser that supports ECMAScript 3 or its latest versions.

```basic
let helloWorld = "Hello World";
          [ let helloWorld: string]
```

There are many programmers who think that javascript and typescript are the same In fact javascript + more features = typescript

### Features of Typescript

1. It's easy to maintain your projects.
    
2. Simple use, debugging, and bug detected at an early stage.
    
3. Supports OOPs and ES6(ECMAScript)
    
4. Full -features IDE support.
    
5. Typescript supports Namespaces, Interfaces, Generics, and access modifiers.

Javascript was developed by Brendan Eich in 1995 and appeared in Netscape, a popular browser of that time. the language was initially called LiveScript and was later renamed JavaScript.JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.

```basic
// printing hello world program in javascript
console.log('Hello World');
```

1. Javascript is an open-source, flexible, dynamic, and cross-platform scripting language
    
2. It can be used for both client-side and server-side
    
3. Lightweight interpreted
    
4. All browsers support
    
5. it reduces server load
    
6. it validates form data
    

## **Difference Between TypeScript and JavaScript**

While comparing two programming languages – TypeScript and JavaScript, we have to consider many factors, which are as below:

### **1) Learning Curve**

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. To write a TypeScript code, you should have a basic understanding and knowledge of JavaScript. Besides, you should be clear with the OOPS concept as well.

### **2) Developers Community**

TypeScript gained its popularity in a short time and was implemented by many enterprises. it has a very active and supportive community.

JavaScript doesn’t have a large community as compared to TypeScript.

### **3) Performance**

As we know, TypeScript was created to overcome the challenges of JavaScript for large-level complex applications. Hence, TypeScript saves development time and allows developers to become more efficient.

### **4) Syntax**

TypeScript offers variable declaration, functional paradigm, and type system, which JavaScript doesn’t offer. It’s similar to JScript and .Net in terms of syntax, with support for ECMAScript 2015 Standard features including modules, an arrow function syntax, and classes.

JavaScript follows the ECMAScript definition as well. However, it’s not a typed language like TypeScript. It uses many structured programming terminologies from C, like if statements, switch statements, do-while loops, and many more. It offers an event-driven style and functional and imperative programming.

### **5) Tools and Frameworks**

Since Microsoft backs TypeScript, it has many leading frameworks and editors. Through tight integration with editors, it provides error handling during compilation to avoid errors at runtime.

there are many [**JavaScript frameworks**](https://radixweb.com/blog/best-javascript-frameworks-for-web-development) available in the market for web development project requirements. It's a huge ecosystem that's quite popular among programmers. You can quickly find developers who specialize in ReactJS, VueJS, Angular, and other frameworks.

### code;- for Typescript

```basic
class Person
{
private name: string;
constructor (private name: string)
{
this.name = name;
}
name()
{
return “name is “ + this.name;
}
}
```

### code;- for Javascript

```basic
var Person = (function()
{
function Person(personName)
{
this.name = personName;
}
Person.prototype.name= function()
{
return "My name is " + this.name;
}
return Person;
})();
```

## FQA;

1. ### why would I use typescript instead of Javascript?
    

\=&gt; Use TypeScript for static typing, better tooling, and improved code quality, while JavaScript provides more flexibility for smaller projects and simpler code. The choice depends on your project's specific needs.

1. ### Is typescript is harder to learn than Javascript?
    

\=&gt; Yes, typescript is a little harder than javascript.

1. ### which one generates slower code?
    
    \=&gt; In Generally, javascript is generating slow code.
    
2. ### which one is better for large-scale projects?
    
    \=&gt; Typescript is better for large-scale Projects.
    

## **Conclusion**

After considering all the information we've gathered in this article, it's clear that both languages have their advantages and disadvantages. In simpler terms, there are good and bad aspects to both languages. Your choice depends on what fits your project best.

TypeScript is suitable for developers who want to create readable code that is neat and clean. Well, we are not mentioning what TypeScript offers are, including various live-bugs checking, and static typing.

Although JavaScript is not a comprehensive programming language, it can be used with HTML to improve the quality of web pages. Moreover, you will find many experienced developers who are proficient in JavaScript coding.

However, TypeScript, like JavaScript, is not supported by all web browsers. So, if you are in a dilemma of choosing between TypeScript vs JavaScript
