## My Journey to Hacktoberfest

## Strategy 1: Participate in pre-September

Like any challenges in life, you need to prepare for it, especially ones like Hacktoberfest. Simply put, open source projects post pre-hacktoberfest repositories where open source contributors make contributions all October long so they can get used to working with Git and GitHub.

## Strategy 2: Support Smaller opens source Project

If you want to contribute to big projects like Microsoft, cal.com facebook projects on your portfolio, feel free but I advise and highly recommend aiming to pick some small projects to increase your chances of getting your contributions reviewed and merged at quickly.

some of them are as below:

Strategy 3: Go Beyond four PRs/Merge request

Well, I decided to take a similar approach to Hacktoberfest. currently, I've had 5 PRs accepted, and I'm not planning to stop there! , Hacktoberfest is a fantastic opportunity to sharpen your skills. Right now, and plan on doing more!

So, there you have it, the three strategies that helped me secure 4 accepted PRs in just one week ! if there's one thing I'd like you to take away from my journey, it's this: plan your path, don't settle for the minimum, and most importantly, savor the experience.

Hacktoberfest isn't just a challenge; it's a celebration of open source . remember always it's contributions not a competition and make some funðŸ˜Š
