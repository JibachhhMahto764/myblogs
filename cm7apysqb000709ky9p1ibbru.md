→ cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computer power, databases, applications, and IT resources via the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

## Cloud Service models

1. ### Iaas (Infrastructure as a service)
    
    →**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** is a cloud computing model that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. It offers on-demand access to networking, storage, and computing power, eliminating the need for organizations to buy and maintain physical hardware.
    
2. ### Paas(Platform as a service)
    
    →**Platform as a Service (PaaS)** is a cloud computing model that provides a **fully managed application development and deployment environment**. It allows developers to build, test, and deploy applications without worrying about managing the underlying infrastructure such as servers, storage, and networking.
    
3. ### Saas(**Software as a Service**)
    
    **Software as a Service (SaaS)** is a cloud computing model where applications are hosted and managed by a cloud provider and made available to users over the internet. Instead of installing and maintaining software on local computers, users can access it via a web browser.
    

## cloud computing deployment models

1. public cloud→ A **public cloud** is a cloud environment **shared** by multiple users.
    
2. private cloud→A **private cloud** is a dedicated cloud environment **used by a single organization.**
    
3. hybrid cloud→A **hybrid cloud** combines **both public and private clouds.**
    

### Advantages of the cloud

* massive economies of scale
    
* low costs
    
* scalability
    
* increase speed and agility
    
* stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers
    
* Go global in minutes
    

### what is virtualization in cloud computing?

virtualization is the core of the cloud computing platform. In the cloud we can create a virtual version of hardware, storage, and OS that can be used to deploy the application.
