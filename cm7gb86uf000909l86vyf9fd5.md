→ The AWS Global Infrastructure is designed and built to deliver a flexible, reliable, scalable, and secure cloud computing environment with high-quality global network performance.

### What are AWS region Factors for AWS Global Infrastructure?

Determine the right Region for your services, applications, and data based on these factors

Selecting a region in AWS Factors points which are written below.

* Data governance
    
* Proximity to customers (latency)
    
* Services available within the Region
    
* Costs (very by Region)
    

### What is AWS Regions

→ An AWS Region is a Physical Geographical location with one or more Availability Zones. An Availability Zone in turn consists of one or more data centers. To achieve fault tolerance and stability AWS regions are isolated from one another.

→ It is your responsibility to replicate data across regions if your business or project needs require it.

→ Additionally some regions have restricted access for example an AWS China region has restricted access outside this region. The account provides access only to the Beijing and Ningxia regions.

→ Communication between Regions uses AWS backbone network infrastructure.

→ Each region provides full redundancy and connectivity to the network.

→ A Region typically consists of two or more Availability Zones.

→ Resources in one region are not automatically replicated in another region.

### What are Availability Zones?

→ There is some variation in the cost of running services, which can depend on which region you choose. An AWS region has multiple isolated locations that are known as Availability Zones

→ Each Region has multiple Availability Zones

→ Each Availability Zone is a fully isolated partition of the AWS Infrastructure.

* There are currently 100 Availability Zones worldwide
    
* Availability Zones consist of discrete(it means 100 or 1000 ) data centers
    
* They are designed for fault isolation
    
* They are interconnected with other Availability Zones by using high-speed private networking
    
* You choose your Availability Zones
    

→ AWs recommends replicating data and resources across Availability Zones for resiliency

### What are AWS data centers?

→ A data center is the location where the actual data resides. Amazon operates state-of-the-art highly available data centers.

→ AWS data centers are securely designed with several factors in mind. Each location is evaluated to mitigate environmental risk.

→ Data centers are where the data resides and data processing occurs

→ Each data center has redundant power, networking, and connectivity, and is housed in a separate facility.

→ A data center typically has more than 50,000 to 80,000 physical servers.

## Points of Presence

* AWS points of presence are located in most of the major cities across 30 countries around the world.
    
* AWS provides a global network of 187 Points of Presence locations
    
* Consists of 176 edge locations and 11 Regional edge caches.
    
    →Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network used to distribute content to end-users to reduce latency default by AWS.
    
    → Amazon Route 53 is a Domain Name System, DNS service where requests going to either one of these services will be routed to the nearest Edge location automatically in order to lower latency.
    
* Regional edge caches are used for content with infrequent access
    
* To deliver an improved near-real-time user experience, points of presence continuously measure Internet connectivity, performance, and computing, to find the best possible way to route the traffic requests. They are used by many AWS services including Amazon CloudFront, Amazon Route 53, AWS Shield, and AWS Web Application Firewall services.
    

## AWS Global Infrastructure Features

→ The AWS Global Infrastructure has several valuable features.

* Elasticity and Scalability.
    
    →Elastic infrastructure; dynamic adaption of capacity
    
    →Scalable infrastructure; adapts to accommodate growth
    
* Fault-tolerance
    
    → Continues operating properly in the presence of the failure
    
    → Built-in redundancy of components
    
* High availability
    
    →High level of operational performance
    
    →Minimized downtime
    
    → No human intervention
